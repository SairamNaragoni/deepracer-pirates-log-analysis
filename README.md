# deepracer-pirates-log-analysis
We built custom interactive graphs using plotly graphing library on top of basic log-analysis provided by the community

## Features
* Accommodated the new log folder structure that we download from console.
* Added entropy graph.
* Added graphs to provide insights on First 25% and last 25% of the training data (works with both simulation_agg and complete_ones dataframes).
* All the plotly functions are present in `plotly_graph_utils.py`. Feel free to make changes to according to your requirement.
